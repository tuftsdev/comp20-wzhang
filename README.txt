1. Revision control and to showcase the work we have done over the comp20 course to family, friends and potential employers.

2. My favorite assignment was assignment 2. I liked it the most because it related to something that we used a lot in life. 
   The notuber assignment made me feel like that I can actually create something that people can use with code.

3. I think I have grown quite a lot. Not only have I learned new programming languages, but also I have learned how to learn.
   I think learning to learn on your own is a very important part of this course because, just as Ming said in our last class,
   computer science is a ever changing and growing field, learning how to learn will be much more important than just learning 
   a few programming languages.

4. Working together with people who know their stuff can make your life much easier.

   Example 1: I was working on lab8 and just could not figure out what I have done wrong because I followed every step of the 
   tutorial on Heroku. Then I asked Ming about it. Within a few mintues, he pointed out that I have written my code in the wrong
   "index.js" file. I did not then realize that there were multiple files named that so I committed the mistake of not checking 
   the location of that file. 

   Example 2: We were working on our final project and we did not know individually how to implement our Facebook bot to send messages
   to the user about the Tufts dining halls. But then when we worked together, we filled in each other's gaps. 


5. I would like to delve deeper into mobile design. After assignment 2, I became more interested in developming mobile apps like uber (or notuber).
